1. first I checked then set the directories
2. then I looked at the files
(I read the instruction files but that's off-code activity)
3. I checked if the row numbers, the feature names etc. in the train and test files are identical (which is important because I have to merge them)
4. I loaded the files containing the labels and variable names 
5. so I can use them to rename the variable names and replace the activity numbers with its names
6. first I did it with test then I did the same with test
7. then I rbinded them
8. then I sorted out the variables that has "mean" or "std" in their name
9. I cbinded them with the subject and activity columns, making a new variable
10. I replaced the long variable names with shorter ones
11. then I subsetted the database according to activities
12. I calculated the averages according to subject in all six
13. I checked their length, then I rbinded them
14. I saved the file in txt
15. then I re-loaded to check if everything is OK
